# 30 Days DevOps Challenge - Weather Dashboard

Day 1: Building a weather data collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

# Weather Data Collection System - DevOps Day 1 Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a Weather Data Collection System that demonstrates core DevOps principles by combining:
- External API Integration (OpenWeather API): Fetching real-time weather data via the OpenWeather API.
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3): Using AWS S3 to store and manage weather data.
- Infrastructure as Code
- Version Control (Git): Manage the project lifecycle with Git.
- Python Development
- Error Handling
- Environment Management: Secure and manage API keys using environment variables.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
- Supports multiple cities tracking
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking
- Error handling for API and cloud interactions.

## Technical Architecture
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (S3)
- **External API:** OpenWeather API
- **Dependencies:** 
  - `boto3` (AWS SDK for Python)
  - `python-dotenv`- (Environment variable management)
  - `requests` - (HTTP library)

```

### 4. Configure AWS CLI
Set up your AWS CLI credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python src/weather_dashboard.py
```
